### Javascript basics

<details>
 <summary>Javascript basics</summary>
 
#### Variables
```
const name = 'Carolina';  // if the value is naver changed
let lastName = 'Ch√°vez';
```

#### String templates
```
 const fullName = `Hola ${name} ${lastName}`;
```

#### Literal Objects
```
 const person ={
  name : 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Wild',
  age: 26,
  address: {
    city: 'Athens',
    zip: '34564'
}
};
```
```
const otherPerson = person; 
```
Referes to the exact same memory space, so any modification to 'otherPerson' will affect the same way the object 'Person'

```
const otherPerson = {...person"};
```
Using the spread operator from Javascript, you will make a copy or clone of the object.

#### Arrays
functions: find, filter, map
```
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let array2 = [...myArray, 5];
const array3 = array.map(function(number){
 return number * 2;
});
```

#### Functions
```
const greet = function(name){
 return `Hola, ${name}`
}
```

```
const greet = (name) => {
 return `Hola, ${name}`
};

const greet = (name) =>  `Hola, ${name}`;

```

#### Promises
they are asyncronous with **async** we can make a function to return a promise, with the async we may handle errors with try-catch
```
const promise = new Promise ((resolve, reject) => {
 //http call
 resolve( http call );
})

promise.then().catch;
```
</details>

### Components
Components are small pieces of code encapsulated and reusable that could or could not have states. An state could how the information of a component could be in certain moment

#### Props, comunication between components

### Hooks

### Testing
We can test React application with [JEST](https://jestjs.io/)

### Useful commands

```
npm start
```
start react project

###  Deploy
[Netify](https://www.netlify.com/)
Front-end application deployment
